    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Bex Porter, the narrator and protagonist of the novel, is an American woman. When the novel begins, she is 20 years old and an art student at Cornell. After meeting Nick during her semester abroad at Oxford, she graduates early and promptly returns to live and work in England to continue her relationship with Nick. At the end of the novel, Bex is in her late 20's, and marrying Nick, making her a Duchess.</p>

    <p>Physically, Bex is tall and thin with long brown hair she frequently wears in a ponytail. Bex prefers plain clothes, such as jeans and t-shirts, and resists the scrutiny the press places on her physical appearance. Bex is outspoken, friendly, and has a dry sense of humor. She is very close to her twin sister, Lacey, and to her father, Earl.</p>
